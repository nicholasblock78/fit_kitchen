#Fit Kitchen

This is my first time developing an app entirely in javascript. I'm looking forward to learning a whole bunch along the way. 

This app builds off the final project I worked on at my time at Dev Bootcamp. We created an app that kept track of a person's pantry, enabling them to search for recipes based on what they had available to them. For this app, I will rebuild that funcitonality but add a Health focus and spin in a rather unique way. You will just have to stay tuned to see what I mean!
